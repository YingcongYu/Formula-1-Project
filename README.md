# Formula-1-Project

### The goal of this project is to analyze and create reports on Formula 1 racing. 
##### To do so, I: 
##### Built a Lakehouse architecture for Formula 1 racing data using Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, and Azure Data Factory with Spark (Python and SQL).
##### Created and configured Databricks clusters and mounted Azure Storage in Databricks using secrets stored in Azure Key Vault to set up an environment for the data engineering solution. 
##### Ingested and transformed CSV and complex JSON files as Delta files and tables, automated the workflow using incremental load pattern by PySpark, and accelerated the workflow by saving 50% running time
##### Conducted descriptive statistical analysis of the transformed tables with Python, visualized the analysis results, and generated reports with Spark SQL to demonstrate findings
##### Established pipelines and dependencies between activities and pipelines, designed the pipelines to tackle unexpected scenarios such as missing files, and integrated data factory triggers to schedule the pipelines
