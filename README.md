# Formula-1-Project

### In this project, I did the followings:
##### Built a Lakehouse architecture for Formula 1 racing data using Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, and Azure Data Factory with Spark (PySpark and SQL)
##### Created and configured Databricks clusters and mounted Azure Storage in Databricks using secrets stored in Azure Key Vault to set up an environment for the data engineering solution. 
##### Ingested and transformed CSV, simple and complex JSON files into the data lake as Delta files and tables by the incremental load pattern.
##### Created pipelines and dependencies between activities and pipelines, designed the pipelines to tackle unexpected scenarios such as missing files, and used data factory triggers to schedule the pipelines.
